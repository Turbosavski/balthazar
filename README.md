open-hardware laptop computer modules

These are electronic schematic modules as presented at https://balthazar.space/wiki/Balthazar
with the main aim for team access

KiCad 5.1.5 files

Three modules:

1. module BalthazarPSU is a combined battery charger, dual buck-boost converter, stereo power amplifier and usb2.0 hub -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarPSU 

2. module BalthazarKeyboard2 is a a bit ergonomic computer keyboard and trackpad built on the basis of ATMega32u4 microcontroller -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarKeyboard2 

3. module BalthazarIO is a simple USB2.0 four-port hub for the internal devices: keyboard and touchpad, webcam and optional audiocard -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarIO 

4. module BalthazarKeyboard is a simplified - a bit ergonomic - computer keyboard with "diy" approach. It is supposed to use Arduino Promicro module -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarKeyboard 

No complete prototype was built yet - these are preliminary files to be checked at some point. 

Five BalthazarKeyboard2 pcb's are being tested https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarKeyboard2

Five BalthazarPSU pcb's are not yet being tested -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarPSU

QMK Firmware is used for keyboards -> https://qmk.fm/

Some philosophy is in the .pdf files included. The newest is no. 3.
