open-hardware laptop computer modules

These are electronic schematic modules as presented at https://balthazar.space/wiki/Balthazar
with the main aim for team access

KiCad 5.1.5 files

Three modules:

1. module BalthazarPSU is a combined battery charger, buck-boost coverter and stereo power amplifier -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarPSU 

2. module BalthazarKeyboard is a simplified a bit ergonomic computer keyboard with "diy" approch. I updated the keyboard to have some more geometric consistency -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarKeyboard 

3. module BalthazarIO is a simple USB2.0 four-port hub for the internal devices: keyboard and touchpad, webcam and optional audiocard -> https://github.com/Turbosavski/balthazarIO 

No prototype was built yet - these are preliminary files to be checked at some point.

Some philosophy is in the .pdf files included. The newest is no. 3.
